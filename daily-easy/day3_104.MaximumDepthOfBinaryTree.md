## Question
Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.<br />The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.<br />**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.<br />**Example:**<br />Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,<br />    3<br />   / \<br />  9  20<br />    /  \<br />   15   7<br />return its depth = 3.

## Thoughts
Since tree is a recursive data structure, it might be eaiser to solve this problem with recursion. Starting from the root, check its left, then check its right, until reach the end which means the node is null. Then we come back up, get the max of the length of left or right, then add one because the node is one layer above them.

## Keys

- This is also a DFS(Depth First Search).
- Know the basic operation and structure of tree.

## Approaches

1. Recursion + DFS
   1. Check if the root/nodes equals to 0, if yes then return 0.
   1. Create a left variable to hold the recursion of left side of nodes of the root node.
   1. Create a right variable to hold the recursion of right side of nodes of the root node.
   1. Return the maximum of the depth of left side of nodes and the depth of right side of nodes, finally add 1 because there is still a root node above them.

## Code
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */

var maxDepth = function(root) {
  if (root === 0) return 0
  let left = maxDepth(root.left)
  let right = maxDepth(root.right)
  return Math.max(left, right) + 1
}
```
