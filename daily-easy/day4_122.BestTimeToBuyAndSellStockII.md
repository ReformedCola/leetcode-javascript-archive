## Question
Say you have an array `prices` for which the _i_ element is the price of a given stock on day _i_.<br />Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).<br />**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).<br />**Example 1:**<br />**Input:** [7,1,5,3,6,4]<br />**Output:** 7<br />**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.<br />             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.<br />**Example 2:**<br />**Input:** [1,2,3,4,5]<br />**Output:** 4<br />**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.<br />             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are<br />             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.<br />**Example 3:**<br />**Input:** [7,6,4,3,1]<br />**Output:** 0<br />**Explanation:** In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.<br /> <br />**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10 ^ 4`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10 ^ 4`

## Thoughts
Same strategy as Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock I, buy low and sell high. Since we don't have limit of transactions, so we just add up all the profit.

## Keys

- Draw a map then you are good to go!

## Approaches

1. Create a variable to hold 0.
1. Use a for loop to iterate through the prices array.
1. Every time when the price of current index is larger than the price of last index, then we add up the profit.
1. Finally, return the profit.

## Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
  let profit = 0
  for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
    if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
      profit = profit + prices[i] - prices[i - 1]
    }
  }
  return profit
};
