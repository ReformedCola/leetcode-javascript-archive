## Question
Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.<br />**Note:**<br />Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?<br />**Example 1:**<br />**Input:** [2,2,1]<br />**Output:** 1<br />**Example 2:**<br />**Input:** [4,1,2,1,2]<br />**Output:** 4

## Thoughts

- Since the time complexity needs to be O(n), and the space complexity needs to be O(1), so we can't use sorting algorithm, neither map data structure.
- So we can use binary operation, which is XOR to solve this problem.

## Keys

- Characteristic of XOR: the result of XOR of two numbers `a^b`  is to calculate each bit of binary of two numbers. If two bits are the same, then gets 0, if different, then gets 1.
- Other characteristic: any number XOR itself = 0, any number XOR 0 = itself.

## Approaches

1. Create a varible to hold the 0.
1. Use a for loop to iterate the array.
1. In the for loop, use the variable I created at the beginning to XOR each elements of the array.
1. Finally, return the variable which will be the number that is single.

## Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var singleNumber = function(nums) {
    let result = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        result ^= nums[i]
    }
    return result
};
